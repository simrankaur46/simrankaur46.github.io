Master of Public Policy Candidate, 2026

she/her

I'm a second-year MPP student at the UC Berkeley Goldman School of Public Policy. I'm interested in economic policy, health policy, and social safety nets. Prior to graduate school, I was a Regulatory Analyst at the California Public Utilities Commission, where I worked on issues related to energy affordability and equity.
